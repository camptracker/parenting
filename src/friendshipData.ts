    overview: "The Harvard Study of Adult Development (75+ years) found one thing matters most for health and happiness: the quality of your relationships. Loneliness is as deadly as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. People with strong social ties have 50% greater survival rates. Friendships aren't optional — they're a health intervention.",
    keyInsights: [
      "Loneliness increases mortality risk by 26% — comparable to obesity",
      "Strong friendships reduce cortisol, lower blood pressure, and boost immune function",
      "People with 3+ close friends report significantly higher life satisfaction",
      "Social connection is the #1 predictor of happiness — above income, career, or fame",
      "The 'friendship recession' is real: Americans report 50% fewer close friends than in 1990",
      "Quality matters far more than quantity — one deep friendship outweighs 50 acquaintances"

    icon: "🤝",
    color: "#7b8f4e",
    overview: "Friendship isn't magic — it follows predictable patterns. Sociologist Rebecca Adams identified three conditions: proximity (physical closeness), repeated unplanned interactions, and a setting that encourages vulnerability. Adults struggle because post-school life removes all three. The fix: engineer these conditions back into your life.",
    keyInsights: [
      "It takes ~50 hours to go from acquaintance → casual friend, ~200 hours → close friend",

    practicalTips: [
      "Join a recurring group (sports league, book club, volunteer crew) — repetition is key",
      "Be the organizer — create events, invite people, suggest plans",
      "Follow the 48-hour rule: follow up within 2 days of meeting someone interesting",
      "Ask real questions: 'What are you excited about right now?' beats 'What do you do?'",

    color: "#b07040",
    overview: "Most friendships die from neglect, not conflict. After school, friendship requires deliberate effort. The best friend-keepers treat connection like a habit: they schedule it, protect it, and prioritize it alongside work and family. Intentionality is what separates acquaintances from lifelong bonds.",
    keyInsights: [
      "The #1 reason adult friendships fade: 'I got busy' — not conflict or betrayal",

    color: "#6b7fa0",
    overview: "Thinkers have wrestled with friendship for millennia. Aristotle identified three types: utility (mutual benefit), pleasure (shared enjoyment), and virtue (deep mutual admiration). Robin Dunbar's research suggests our brains can handle ~150 relationships, but only ~5 intimate ones. These frameworks help you understand what you have and what you're building toward.",
    keyInsights: [
      "Aristotle's 3 types: utility friends (co-workers), pleasure friends (drinking buddies), virtue friends (soul-deep). Most are type 1 or 2 — and that's fine",
      "Dunbar's layers: 5 intimate → 15 close → 50 friends → 150 acquaintances. Each layer requires different investment",
      "Stoic view: a true friend is 'another self' — choose friends who make you better",
      "Buddhist view: friendships should reduce suffering, not create attachment and expectation",
      "Modern research: 'social convoys' — your inner circle changes over time, and that's healthy",
      "Friendship is asymmetric: studies show only 50% of friendships are reciprocal"
    ],
    practicalTips: [
      "Map your friendships to Dunbar's layers — where are the gaps?",
      "Don't force all friendships to be 'virtue' friendships — utility and pleasure friends matter too",
      "Apply Aristotle's test: does this friendship make both of us better people?",

    icon: "⚡",
    color: "#8b6b8f",
    overview: "Research consistently shows structural differences in how men and women tend to build friendships. Men often bond 'shoulder-to-shoulder' through shared activities. Women often bond 'face-to-face' through conversation and emotional disclosure. Neither is superior — but understanding the patterns helps everyone build better connections.",
    keyInsights: [
      "Men's friendships: often activity-based (sports, gaming, projects). Emotional intimacy expressed through loyalty, presence, and banter rather than direct conversation",
      "Women's friendships: often conversation-based. Higher emotional disclosure, more frequent contact, more verbal affection",
      "Men report fewer close friends on average (2-3 vs 3-5 for women) and are more likely to name their partner as their only confidant",
      "The 'male loneliness epidemic': men are increasingly isolated, with friendship quality declining faster than women's",
      "Cultural pressure: men face stigma around emotional vulnerability with other men ('that's gay/weird')",
      "These are trends, not rules — many men crave deep emotional connection and many women prefer activity-based bonds"
    ],
    practicalTips: [
      "Men: try adding a 5-minute real check-in before/after activities with friends",
      "Women: try adding more shared activities alongside conversation",
      "Everyone: be the friend who normalizes asking 'how are you, really?'",
      "Challenge the idea that emotional depth requires hours of talking — a single honest sentence counts",
      "Create spaces where vulnerability is safe — fishing trips, long drives, walks",

    color: "#5e8c7a",
    overview: "Friendships shift dramatically across life stages. Childhood friends share proximity. Teen friends share identity exploration. In your 20s, friends are everywhere. Then marriage, kids, and career create the 'friendship recession' of your 30s. Understanding these patterns helps you navigate transitions without losing connection entirely.",
    keyInsights: [
      "Childhood (5-12): friendships based on proximity and play. 'Best friends' change weekly — that's normal",
      "Teens (13-19): friends become identity mirrors. Peer influence peaks. Friendships feel life-or-death because socially, they are",
      "20s: golden age of friendship. Time, energy, proximity. Friend groups form around shared experiences (college, first jobs, city life)",
      "30s: the great pruning. Marriage, kids, career compress social time. Average Americans lose 2 close friends per decade after 25",
      "40s+: quality over quantity crystallizes. People invest in fewer, deeper friendships. New friendships become harder but more intentional",
      "Major transitions (divorce, job loss, moving) can both destroy and create friendship opportunities"
    ],
    practicalTips: [
      "In your 20s: invest heavily — these friendships can last decades if maintained",
      "When you marry/partner: protect friend time. Don't let coupledom absorb everything",
      "With young kids: befriend other parents, but don't lose non-parent friends",
      "After a move: join 3 groups in the first month. Momentum matters",
      "In your 40s+: be the initiator. Everyone's waiting for someone else to make plans",

    tagline: "Your attachment style shapes every friendship you have",
    icon: "🧠",
    color: "#a07050",
    overview: "How you handle emotions determines how your friendships function. Attachment theory (secure, anxious, avoidant) doesn't just apply to romance — it shapes how you show up for friends, handle conflict, and tolerate closeness. Emotional intelligence is the invisible infrastructure of every good friendship.",
    keyInsights: [
      "Secure attachment: comfortable with closeness AND independence. Can handle conflict without catastrophizing or withdrawing",
      "Anxious attachment: fears abandonment. May over-text, read into silences, need constant reassurance from friends",
      "Avoidant attachment: uncomfortable with closeness. May ghost, keep people at arm's length, dismiss the need for friends",
      "You can have different attachment patterns with different friends",
      "Conflict handled well actually DEEPENS friendships — repair after rupture builds trust",
      "Emotional contagion is real: your friends' moods affect yours (and vice versa) up to 3 degrees of separation"

    practicalTips: [
      "Learn your attachment style — it explains 80% of your friendship frustrations",
      "When hurt by a friend: express it directly. 'When you did X, I felt Y' > silent resentment",
      "Practice the 'repair conversation': acknowledge the rupture, take responsibility, express care",
      "Build emotional vocabulary — 'I'm fine' is almost never true or helpful",
      "If you're avoidant: challenge yourself to reach out once a week even when you don't 'feel like it'",
